# App Published (Ready for Deployment)

I have successfully built the application! The `dist` folder is ready.

I also fixed several TypeScript errors in `src/types/supabase.ts` that were preventing the build and pushed those fixes to GitHub.

## Next Steps

1.  Open the **[Deployment Guide](file:///C:/Users/abdus/.gemini/antigravity/brain/62e52596-ddae-4f53-a550-6afa40a95e50/deployment_guide.md)**.
2.  Follow the instructions to deploy to **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
3.  **Crucial:** Don't forget to set your Environment Variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in your hosting dashboard!

The code is verified and pushed to `main`.
